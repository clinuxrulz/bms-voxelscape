// The models an account has published, read without signing in to anything.
//
// A model is a drawing somebody made in rm-stacker and published to their own
// account: a record naming it, pointing at the zip the editor saves. Both the
// record and the zip are public, so dressing this world in somebody's drawing
// costs nothing but their name — no session, no account of this world's own,
// and nothing asked of the person who drew it.
//
// The vocabulary itself comes from the editor that writes it
// (`@big-mesh-studios/rm-stacker/lexicon`), so the collection these records
// live in is named in one place across the two programs.
